## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ Emergency Department Throughput Optimization

Tech Stack: SQL | Power BI | Excel | Visio

**📘 Overview:**
Led a data analytics and process optimization project to reduce patient wait times and improve throughput in a high-volume emergency department. Combined data modeling, KPI dashboards, and workflow mapping to identify and resolve bottlenecks in triage, staffing, and discharge processes.

**🧩 Business Problem:**
The emergency department struggled with long wait times, uneven staffing coverage, and high walkout rates during peak hours. Leadership lacked visibility into real-time throughput metrics and staffing-demand alignment, limiting their ability to respond to congestion.

**💡 Solution:**
- Mapped the end-to-end ED workflow (arrival → triage → provider evaluation → discharge) using Visio to identify bottlenecks.
- Developed SQL queries to calculate average wait times, provider utilization, and patient-to-staff ratios by shift.
- Designed Power BI dashboards for real-time visibility into key KPIs such as throughput, no-show rates, and high-acuity delays.
- Implemented “Critical Delay Detection” logic to flag patients exceeding safe wait thresholds.
- Presented findings to leadership, informing data-driven scheduling and staffing adjustments.
  
**📈 Impact:**
- ⏱️ Reduced average wait times by ~18% through targeted staffing realignment
- 🚶‍♂️ Decreased walkout rates by ~22%
- 📊 Improved visibility into operational performance, enabling proactive resource management

### 2️⃣ COBRA Initiation Process Optimization

Tech Stack: SQL | Tableau | Excel | Visio | Salesforce CRM

**📘 Overview:** Designed and implemented a data-driven process improvement initiative to streamline COBRA benefit initiation by introducing an online enrollment option for eligible members. This project reduced administrative lag, improved compliance tracking, and enhanced the member experience.

**🧩 Business Problem:**
The COBRA initiation process relied heavily on physical mailing of election packets to newly terminated employees, which caused:
- Delays in notification and enrollment timelines
- Missed election deadlines and compliance risks
- High call volumes from confused members
- Limited visibility into initiation status across employer
  
Operations needed a faster, digital-first process to improve efficiency and ensure compliance with DOL timelines.

**💡 Solution:**
- Mapped the existing COBRA initiation workflow using Visio, identifying bottlenecks in packet generation, mailing, and manual data entry.
- Partnered with IT and client-service teams to design an online COBRA enrollment portal that allowed eligible members to receive notifications and submit elections electronically.
- Developed SQL queries to track initiation-to-election timelines, identify late mailings, and monitor portal adoption metrics.
- Created Tableau dashboards to visualize SLA compliance, enrollment lag, and digital adoption trends for leadership.
- Revised SOPs and training materials to standardize the new digital process across employer groups and internal teams.

**📈 Impact:**
- ⏱️ Reduced initiation processing time by ~30%
- 📬 Decreased paper mailing volume by ~40%, cutting costs and manual handling
- ✅ Improved compliance accuracy and on-time notification rates
- 📊 Increased real-time visibility into initiation and enrollment KPIs for management
