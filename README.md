## ðŸ“Œ Introduction 
Hi there! Iâ€™m a Operations Analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and organizational outcomes. With hands-on experience in data analytics, process improvement, and stakeholder collaboration across healthcare and benefits administration environments, I specialize in turning real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

I enjoy working at the intersection of clinical operations, analytics, and quality improvement â€” leveraging tools like SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to measure performance, identify trends, and drive meaningful change.

This portfolio showcases examples of my work in:
- Healthcare data analysis and visualization
- Operational process improvement
- KPI tracking and dashboard design
- Data storytelling for executive decision support
  
Iâ€™m passionate about using data to make healthcare smarter, more efficient, and more patient-centered.
