### 1️⃣ Emergency Department Throughput Optimization

Tech Stack: SQL | Power BI | Excel | Visio

**📘 Overview:**
Led a data analytics and process optimization project to reduce patient wait times and improve throughput in a high-volume emergency department. Combined data modeling, KPI dashboards, and workflow mapping to identify and resolve bottlenecks in triage, staffing, and discharge processes.

**🧩 Business Problem:**
The emergency department struggled with long wait times, uneven staffing coverage, and high walkout rates during peak hours. Leadership lacked visibility into real-time throughput metrics and staffing-demand alignment, limiting their ability to respond to congestion.

**💡 Solution:**
- Mapped the end-to-end ED workflow (arrival → triage → provider evaluation → discharge) using Visio to identify bottlenecks.
- Developed SQL queries to calculate average wait times, provider utilization, and patient-to-staff ratios by shift.
- Designed Power BI dashboards for real-time visibility into key KPIs such as throughput, no-show rates, and high-acuity delays.
- Implemented “Critical Delay Detection” logic to flag patients exceeding safe wait thresholds.
- Presented findings to leadership, informing data-driven scheduling and staffing adjustments.
  
**📈 Impact:**
- ⏱️ Reduced average wait times by ~18% through targeted staffing realignment
- 🚶‍♂️ Decreased walkout rates by ~22%
- 📊 Improved visibility into operational performance, enabling proactive resource management
