## üìå Introduction 
Hi there! I‚Äôm a Operations Analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and organizational outcomes. With hands-on experience in data analytics, process improvement, and stakeholder collaboration across healthcare and benefits administration environments, I specialize in turning real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics and optimization projects in the healthcare data and systems domain.

It integrates technical expertise (SQL, Tableau, Power BI, AI-powered analytics) with healthcare domain knowledge (EMR/EHR workflows, compliance, and process improvement).

Each project demonstrates how data can drive operational excellence, enhance care delivery, and support informed decision-making across healthcare organizations.
