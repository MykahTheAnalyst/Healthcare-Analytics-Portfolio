## 📌 Introduction 
Hi there! I’m a Operations Analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and organizational outcomes. With hands-on experience in data analytics, process improvement, and stakeholder collaboration across healthcare and benefits administration environments, I specialize in turning real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics and optimization projects in the healthcare data and systems domain.

It integrates technical expertise (SQL, Excel, Power BI) with healthcare domain knowledge (EMR/EHR workflows, compliance, and process improvement).

Each project demonstrates how data can drive operational excellence, enhance care delivery, and support informed decision-making across healthcare organizations.

## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ "Emergency Department Operations Analysis: Identifying Drivers of Wait Time and Patient Walkouts"

**📘Project Overview:** This project focuses on improving emergency department operational performance through advanced analytics and dashboarding.
Using SQL Server and Power BI, the analysis identifies peak congestion times, staffing bottlenecks, and walkout trends to drive faster patient throughput and resource allocation.

**🩺 Business Problem:** Emergency Departments (EDs) face significant challenges balancing patient volume, acuity, and staffing constraints.
Common issues include:
- Long patient wait times during peak hours
- Inconsistent staff coverage across shifts
- Rising walkout (LWBS) rates due to excessive delays
- Lack of real-time visibility into performance metrics
  
These factors directly affect patient outcomes, satisfaction, and regulatory compliance.

**💡 Solution:**
A set of data models, SQL queries, and Power BI dashboards were created to identify operational inefficiencies and enable continuous performance monitoring.

**Key Actions:**
- Built SQL models calculating average wait times, walkout rates, and staffing correlations.
- Created shift-level KPIs for throughput, workload, and patient flow performance.
- Implemented “Critical Delay Detection” logic to flag high-acuity patients waiting beyond safe thresholds.
- Developed a Power BI dashboard displaying:
  - Wait time by triage level
  - Staffing-to-demand correlation
  - Peak arrival time heatmaps
  - Walkout rate trends

**Impact:**
↓ Average wait times by 18%
↓ Walkout rates by 22%
↑ Data-driven staffing and scheduling decisions

### 2️⃣ Outpatient / EHR Workflow Optimization

**📘 Project Overview:**
This project focuses on optimizing outpatient encounter workflows within an EHR (Electronic Health Record) system to enhance documentation efficiency, provider compliance, and operational performance.
By mapping current workflows and leveraging data analytics, the goal is to reduce documentation time, streamline provider tasks, and minimize redundant work—all while maintaining regulatory and clinical accuracy.

**🩺 Business Problem**
Outpatient departments often face inefficiencies due to fragmented EHR workflows, inconsistent documentation standards, and manual rework.
Providers spend excessive time on data entry and record completion, leading to:
- Delayed chart closures
- Reduced patient throughput
- Compliance and audit risks
- Staff burnout and lower patient satisfaction
  
These challenges result in slower clinical operations and hinder value-based care delivery.

**💡 Solution:**
The project applies a data-driven approach to identify and eliminate workflow bottlenecks across the outpatient encounter lifecycle:
Registration → Triage → Provider Visit → Documentation → Discharge 

**Key Actions:**
- Designed current-state and future-state workflow diagrams to visualize inefficiencies.
- Developed SQL queries to calculate encounter cycle time, identify rework trends, and measure compliance.
- Delivered recommendations for EHR optimization, including auto-populated templates and streamlined task routing.
- Defined KPI dashboards tracking:
    - Documentation completion rate
    - Average documentation time per provider
    - Encounter cycle-time from registration to discharge
  
**Impact:**
↓ 20–30% documentation lag
↑ Compliance and data quality
↓ Manual rework for clinical staff
