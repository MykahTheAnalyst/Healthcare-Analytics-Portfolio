## üìå Introduction 
Hi there! I‚Äôm a Operations Analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and organizational outcomes. With hands-on experience in data analytics, process improvement, and stakeholder collaboration across healthcare and benefits administration environments, I specialize in turning real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics and optimization projects in the healthcare data and systems domain.

It integrates technical expertise (SQL, Tableau, Power BI, AI-powered analytics) with healthcare domain knowledge (EMR/EHR workflows, compliance, and process improvement).

Each project demonstrates how data can drive operational excellence, enhance care delivery, and support informed decision-making across healthcare organizations.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ "Emergency Department Operations Analysis: Identifying Drivers of Wait Time and Patient Walkouts"
**Project Overview:** This project analyzes emergency department (ED) operational data to identify factors influencing patient wait times, staffing efficiency, and walkout rates. Using SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling techniques, the analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can inform quality improvement and workforce planning within a healthcare setting.

The dataset includes key operational variables such as shift type, triage level, staff coverage, number of critical cases, and patient walkouts. Through exploratory analysis and dashboard visualizations, the project highlights trends and correlations that can guide evidence-based decision-making for hospital operations teams.

**Business Problem:** Emergency Departments face ongoing challenges with patient throughput, wait time management, and staff allocation. Long wait times and high walkout rates negatively impact both patient experience and clinical outcomes.
This analysis explores questions such as:
- How do staffing levels and shift patterns affect wait times?
- Are critical case volumes correlated with operational slowdowns?
- What patterns exist between triage level and walkout likelihood?
